So many people message me that I might as well save myself time, this was my Facebook full time on site interview experience in short:
1. Given an array of ints, each following the rule n +- 1 so (4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2) find the local max/min and print them all out
2. Given 2 pairs of points, each representing a line on a line segment tell me if the pairs intersect infinitely or not
3. Given a string of a number (example '10101' or '9123') and a map of integers to chars (1 => a,â€¦ 26 => z) print out how many combination there are. (ie: 111 => aaa OR ak OR ka = 3 return combinations)
those were the questions asked the third question I have heard multiple people being asked
you will have three interviews one hour each in a row, no breaks
all will be technical and one will be half social
Thats it then you will get food and chill out with the other interviewees, the campus is great!
you will get a tour
you will be interviewing with others, I interviewed with 50 other people
do not be intimidated by any of them, socialize with them and get to know them
Good luck!! Feel free to message me more in depth, I love to help out and just talk to many people.
