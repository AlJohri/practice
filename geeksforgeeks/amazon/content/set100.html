<div class="post-content" id="post-content">
					<p>First of all many many thanks to geeksforgeeks for such a great guidance. Amazon  visited our campus for recruitment. Here is my interview experience. <span id="more-130452"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round -1</strong><br>
20 MCQs (C ,Aptitude,DS,DBMS,Networks)<br>
2 programming questions were asked-<br>
1.) Print all root to leaf path of a given binary tree whose path sum is a given value k.<br>
Note:  tree was given in the form of array (so no need to create the tree).<br>
Input: Input contains two space separated integers K and L followed by 2^L-1 space separated values<br>
Output: All root to leaf path which has a path sum = k.<br>
Sample Test case :<br>
Input :<br>
40 4 10 11 13 # 15 28 6 # # 8 4 # 9 11 #<br>
Output:<br>
10 11 15 4<br>
10 13 6 11</p>
<p>2.) Given few sets of intervals print out the the entire intervals without overlapping, if they overlap then combine them into one.<br>
Sample test case:
</p><pre>
Input :    (5,7) (1 , 6) (2 ,4) (10 ,14) (8,9) 
Output :   (1,7) (8,9) (10,14) </pre>
<p><strong>Group fly Round:</strong><br>
2 ques were asked in this round. We were asked to write code on paper  very fast.(It was an elimination round. </p>
<p>1.)	Given a binary tree as below
</p><pre>
                               A
		            /    \
		           B	  C
			       /    \
 			      D      E
		             /     /   \
		            F    G      H </pre>
<p>Convert the structure of the tree  like a left aligned tree whose each node contains a down pointer and a right pointer  and looks like the below tree..
</p><pre>
			A
			|
			B &#226;&#128;&#147; C
			|
			D&#226;&#128;&#148;E
			|
			F&#226;&#128;&#148;G &#226;&#128;&#147; H</pre>
<p>2.)The arrival and departure time of trains are given.  Find the minimum number of platforms to accommodate  all the trains.
</p><pre>
Eg.		Arrival 	Departure
		7		11
		8		10
		13		14
		4 		6
Output:   2 </pre>
<p><strong>Round 2. (F2F)</strong><br>
1.	An array is given in which elements are first monotonically increasing and then decreasing.<br>
Search an element in the array. Working code was asked which takes care of all the edge cases. Also asked the time complexity of the code.</p>
<p>2.	Implement queue using 2 stacks .<br>
What would be the complexity of enqueue and dequeue operation. I told him O(1) for enqueue and O(n) for dequeue.	Then he asked to optimize it. Then he asked the Average case time complexity. </p>
<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F)</strong><br>
1. You are given a graph. Write a function to remove  all the cycles. Means after the function call the graph must be converted into a connected acyclic graph(tree).<br>
2.	What happens when u send an email to someone.<br>
3.	What is socket ? What is port?<br>
4.	Which protocol is secure for mail transfer? Which protocol is used by Gmail?<br>
5.	What is the port number of SMTP?<br>
6.	Suppose u open notepad and type something  and save it what would happen.<br>
7.	What is static member?<br>
8.	What is singleton class??<br>
9.	If a class has all its members as static would it be a singleton class? Compare  them.<br>
10.	What is process scheduling? How does it happen? What are various queues maintained  by the system? (Where does the scheduler process run ??- This ques was asked in 2nd round of DE Shaw &amp; co).<br>
11.	Suppose  various process are waiting for a particular resource? What is this situation called? How does the system overcome from this problem?<br>
12.	What the various ways of process communication?<br>
13.	What is thrashing ?How to overcome from it?</p>
<p><strong>Round: 4.)(HR + Technical)</strong><br>
1.	Tell me something about yourself<br>
2.	A long discussion on project. Brief description. How can you improve it?What changes will make if I ask you to develop it again? Give example of implementation of various oops concept in your  project.<br>
3.	What is multithreading? Then he said that there are situations where there is no need of multithreading.eg- if I want to add two numbers then no point of using multithreading.So give an example where you can actually implement multithreading. (ANS &#226;&#128;&#147; Fibonacci number)<br>
4.	Some behavioral questions like-<br>
 What are you  good at?<br>
What are you proud of?<br>
What are the things you want to change in yourself?etc.</p>
<p>5.	Various oops concept like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance , etc. with example.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Don&#226;&#128;&#153;t start writing the code immediately.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	First tell him the approach .<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Take care of all the edge cases.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Many times interview may give you hints so make the interview interactive.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Very Important &#8211; Don&#226;&#128;&#153;t  focus  just on  a particular subject like only DS.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	More or less give time to everything.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Study the concepts of OOPS and OS properly.<br>
&#226;&#128;&#162;	Have a basic Idea of DBMS and Computer Networks also.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>
