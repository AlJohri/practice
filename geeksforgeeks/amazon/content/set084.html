After some friendly talk, jumped on technical but easy questions :<br>

2. Difference between Dijkstra and BFS.<br>
3. Given a linked list, find out if the list is circular, also find the point from where the cycle start.<br>
4. Given an array, find the max sum over a sub array.<br>
5. If you have two eggs, how many max steps you need to find the floor, from which the eggs break.<br>
And some more easy questions.</p>
<p>It was already 5, so they decided to have further rounds later.</p>
<p>10 days later I had attended interviews :</p>
<p><strong>First Round :</strong><br>
1. Asked about heaps, given an array, tell if it is min heap, if not, apply operation min-heapify.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    a.  What happens when two numbers map to same key?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    b.  how does chaining work?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    c. What to do when you have a bad hashing function, and only we can modify the structure of hashmap not hashing function?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    d. What do to when you your hashmap is filled completely (as in all the linked list are filled up to their capacity)<br>
4. What is quicksort? Implement for a linked list and tell complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Second Round :</strong><br>
1. What is quicksort?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   a. What is complexity when all elements are sorted and how can you improve it? (Randomization)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   b. Will randomization work when elements are same?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   c. What algorithms sort equal elements in O(n) time ?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   d. using the information, how can you improve quick-sort? Think about it, its good. Don&#8217;t want to spoil it for you by writing answer here.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   e. implement this modification.</p>
<p>2. Given two river banks (visualization : two parallel lines), one bank has numbers written (1&#8230;.n) in sorted order. On the other bank the numbers (1&#8230;n) are arranged randomly. A bridge can be formed from the ith point from bank 1 to ith point in bank 2. Find the max number of non-intersecting bridges you can form?</p>
<p>3. Given 1&#8230;n , and given some statements like i hates j, then find some arrangement of n numbers such that if i hates j then in the arrangement i comes before j. Say 1 hates 2, then 123456789 is acceptable but 213456789 is not.</p>

3. Implement a calculator which takes a maths expression and evaluates it and prints the result.<br>
4. Given statements like A is connected to B. D is connected to E. And transitive connections are allowed. Write a code which takes input such connected statements and and two numbers i and j and returns true if i and j are connected (can be transitively), and false if not connected.</p>
