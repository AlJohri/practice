					<p><strong>Online Round</strong><br>
1.	Convert Binary tree to linked list.<br>
2.	Rotate a matrix by 90 degree.<span id="more-132803"></span><br>
There were 2 more questions. But I forgot what were they?</p>
<p><strong>Telephonic Interview</strong><br>
Overview of my resume, current role responsibilities and asked to explain internship project in brief.<br>
1. What is the definition of tree ?<br>
2. What are the differences between graph and tree?<br>
3. When can you say a graph to be a tree?<br>
4. Write a program to show whether a graph is a tree or not using adjacency matrix.<br>
Its always good to ask questions at the end. It shows our interest towards the company.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 1</strong><br>
Overview of current job responsibilities and internship project.<br>
1.	Convert a tree to a sum tree.
</p><pre>
Example :
       1                            27
     /   \                        /   \
   2       3     -------&gt;       9      13
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 0  0    0  0 </pre>
<p>Always take care of all the corner cases<br>
2.	Print a pascal tree .<br>
3.	Given a 2D matrix sorted row wise and column wise . Print the matrix in sorted way. (Can be done using Min Heap).<br>
For all the questions, complexity of the program was asked and was being asked to improve both time and space complexity.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 2</strong><br>
Many questions regarding my current project, tools and technology I am working on.<br>
1.	Convert a binary tree to a sum tree . Here he had a new meaning of sum tree.<br>
Example :</p>
<pre>
Example :
       1                            1
     /   \                        /   \
   2       3     -------&gt;       2      5
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 4   9   15  22 </pre>
<p>(I did it with Level Order Traversal) (Complete working code was required)<br>
2.	Given an array of integers. Find the largest 3 element. (Can be done using Max Heap in less time complexity)</p>
<p><strong>F2F 3 </strong><br>
Lots of questions on my current work and tools which I was using.<br>
Why do I want to leave my current company on such a short interval of 5 months.<br>
Why Amazon ?<br>
What inspires you to join Amazon? Why dream company ?<br>
1.	Connect Sibling pointers. I gave a Level Order Traversal solution. He asked to do it in O(1) space complexity. I explained the approach but messed up In writing the working code for that.<br>
2.	Explain the approach of LRU cache and implement using object oriented language.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 4</strong><br>
Why Amazon?<br>
Why do you want to leave your current company in such a short interval?<br>
Did u ask your current company to provide that type of work as u r looking in Amazon?<br>
1.	Design a system for finding the costliest element always whenever we pick up an element from a box.(concept of Max Heap)<br>
2.	A stream of data is coming. Maintain records in a page and mechanism to see  previous and next page. (Concept of Doubly Linked List)<br>
(It is always advisable to ask questions in design questions. The interviewers expect that we will be asking questions for clarification)<br>
What is thread?<br>
What is the meaning of memory leakage?<br>
Followed by many OS questions but I forgot.<br>
In every round , after each question , complexity of the algorithm was asked. Its good to ask questions to get more clarification about the question.</p>
<p>I want to thank the entire team of geeksforgeeks. It is a great portal and it helped me a lot in preparing for Amazon interview. </p>
