					<p>Believe me or not before I faced an Amazon interview round I was never sure whether all those gratitude that people usually present to GeeksforGeeks were actually worth.<span id="more-125960"></span> But it is always easier to connect the dots looking backwards and now I can say with assurance that this website really deserves all the applause.</p>
<p>I was recently interviewed for an internship position at Amazon and had to go through a total of 3 rounds i.e. one online followed by two telephonic rounds.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Round</span></b><br>
As usual the online round had two coding questions and 20 MCQs. This was a pretty easy round and it&#8217;s duration was 90 minutes. The round consisted of questions from various domains like Algorithm, Data Structure, Operating System and Aptitude.</p>
<p>A few days after appearing in this round, I was informed that I have been qualified for the next round.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Telephonic Round&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;</span></b><br>
I had just three days to prepare for this round and truly speaking, it was my first experience of appearing in any such interview.</p>
<p>This round lasted for almost 60 minutes. It began with my general introduction followed by a brief discussion on my projects. After this, the interviewer asked me four questions.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></b><br>
Given an array of numbers find all such triplets that satisfy the given condition.</p>
<p><b>Condition:&#194;&#160;</b>a[i] &lt; a[j] &lt; a[k] where I &lt; j &lt; k.</p>
<p>At first go I thought that it was a pretty easy question but slowly the mist started to clear and I realized how tough it was. The interviewer wanted me to solve it in linear time i.e. O(N)</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:</span></b><br>
Given two trees check if they are mirror images of each other or not.<br>
This was a straight forward question and it took me less than 10 minutes to code it.<br>
Now the interviewer wanted to test my understanding of operating systems and asked two fairly direct questions, to which I gave my answer based on my understanding (not bookish definition as I did not remember any of those <img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> ).</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3 &amp; 4:</span></b><br>
What is semaphore and what do you mean by a deadlock.</p>
<p>After two days I got a call from the HR informing me I have been selected for the next round. Now it was the time for the last and the decisive round.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Telephonic Round&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;</span></b></p>
<p>For this round I had slightly more time than the last, due to the fact that the weekend fell in between.The interviewer was very very cool and helping this time, something which I kept at the last in my list of probable things that can happen during an interview. Duration of this round was around 90 minutes.</p>
<p>This time I had to face three technical questions and one general question on Amazon.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></b><br>
Given a BST, replace each node with the sum of the values of all the nodes that are greater than that node. Only constraint being that I was not allowed to use any global or static variable.<br>
Although I panicked a bit and made few mistakes, I got through.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:</span></b><br>
Given an array of numbers find the maximum count of duplets and triplets such that there sum is a multiple of three. Number that has appeared once can&#226;&#128;&#153;t be included anywhere else.<br>
I solved this question using a property of modulus.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3:&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;</span></b><br>
Given the stock prices of 10 days find the best possible buy sell pair.<br>
For this question I started with a O(N<sup>2</sup>) solution but then finally managed to reduce it to O(N) solution with constant space complexity.</p>
<p>I was also asked few questions on Amazon like what are domains in which Amazon deals.</p>
