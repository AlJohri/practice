					<p>Hi, I am Mayur Kale,I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon in our campus and got selected. Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I prepared only from Geeksforgeeks.org. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team.<span id="more-117021"></span></p>
<p>Onw online coding test followed by 4 rounds of F2F interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Online Coding Test (2 Problems,20 MCQs, 1:30 hours) </strong>From Interviewstreet<br>
All problems had multiple test cases for which the code was validated against.<br>
1. from input string we have to print character which occurs maximum number of times. </p>
<p><strong>Face to face: Round 1(Technical, 1 hour):</strong><br>
1. Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1 (time complexity expected was O(M*N) and space O(1))<br>
Solution: <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-boolean-matrix-question/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-boolean-matrix-question/</a></p>
<p>2. Given binary tree, if we draw a line from root then we have to print all nodes on that line.</p>
<p>Code for both questions was required and some other discussion happened..</p>
<p><strong>Face to face: Round 2(Technical, 1 hour):</strong><br>
1. Given string we have insert %20 on each space and input string has enough memory to contain output string.<br>
(time complexity expected was O(n) and space was O(1).</p>
<p>2.merge point of linked list.<br>
 (I told I know this question so he moved ahead..)<br>
3.Given binary search tree in array form and we have to check whether it is fully binary tree or not..<br>
  (I gave O(n^2) solution but He was expecting O(n) solution after some discussion I managed to give answer in O(n) complexity&#8230;)<br>
4. Given that integers are read from a data stream. We have to find k maximum elements from that stream&#8230;<br>
  (I gave solution of insertion sort,then come to heap)</p>
<p>code for all questions required and nice discussion was there&#8230;<br>
He was very impressed with my answers&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Face to face: Round 3(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):</strong></p>
<p>-He asked me to choose topic on which questions should ask..<br>
  I chose OS&#8230;<br>
-some questions on paging and virtual memory.</p>
<p>-If we use 8 GB RAM for 32 bit machine what will happen?<br>
  It was nice question..<br>
  He was very impressed with answer.<br>
-Some discussion on Networking(DHCP and DNS).<br>
-Some discussion on Linker and Loader.<br>
-Some discussion on JAVA.<br>
-Some discussion on DBMS.</p>
<p>-one puzzle<br>
A champagne pyramid is a pyramid made of champagne glasses , each of equal capacity say , n. The pyramid begins with one glass at the top level , two glasses at the second level , then three below that and so on up to infinite levels. A level x of the pyramid thus has x no. of champagne glasses.</p>
<p>A steady stream of champagne is poured down from the top level,which trickles down to the lower levels. What is the distribution of champagne in the glasses at a given level i.<br>
(I told I know this puzzle then he moved ahead..)</p>
<p>-Give a Building with n floor. A person can take 1 step or 2 step to climb. Find the number of ways to reach nth floor. Code was required</p>
<p>Interviewer was very happy after that.</p>
<p><strong>Face to face: Round 4(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):</strong><br>
It was like semi HR round.<br>
1. Why Computer science?<br>
2. Given an array of integers which is initially increasing and then decreasing, find the maximum value in the array.<br>
<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/</a><br>
3. Modified k heavy path in binary tree problem.</p>
<p>In evening they told me result and I got selected in amazon. It was very nice experience for me.</p>
