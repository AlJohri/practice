					<p>The first round was an online test hosted on Interviewstreet.com. Around 350 students appeared in the online test.<span id="more-128168"></span> The duration was 90 minutes. It consisted of 20 MCQs based primarily on Predicting The Output, OS, CN and Data Structures.</p>
<p>These questions were pretty basic and easily solvable.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there were 2 coding questions.</p>
<p>1. Given a string, find the first element which is non -repetitive  i.e that element must not be present anywhere else in the string.
</p><pre>  
          Eg : Input : teeterson      
               Output : r, as it is the first element which 
                        is non repetitive. </pre>
<p>2.  Given a string of digits,find the next smallest number using the same digits.If its not possible to  get such a number print -1;
</p><pre>     
        Eg : Input : "123"  Output : "132"
             Input : "12453" Output : "123534"
             Input : "987"     Output :  "-1" </pre>
<p>After a week, the results came out and 25 students were shortlisted.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Interviews: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical Interview 1 :</strong></p>
<p>1. Given an array of 1s followed by 0s,find the number of 0s.
</p><pre>  
     Eg : Input : 111100    Output =2
          Input : 1         Output =0 </pre>
<p>I solved it by using Binary Search to find the first and last occurrence of 0 in the array and subtracting the results.</p>
<p>2. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find the pair of elements whose sum is closest to 0.
</p><pre>   
     Eg : Input :  3 5 -9 -4 17 11       
          Output  3 , -4  </pre>
<p>The brute force solution would be O(n^2) by comparing each pair of elements.As expected, he asked me to optimize my solution.<br>
So I sorted the array using merge sort. (I know its not in-place but it did not strike me at the time)<br>
Then used two indexes at the beginning and end of the the array and incremented/decremented the indexes as needed.</p>
<p>3. Given a Binary Tree , print all the root to leaf paths.</p>
<p>I started by telling him my approach and the logic behind the recursive solution that I had in mind. Then he asked me to write test cases for the function that I had written.</p>
<p>6 students were selected after this round.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Interview 2</strong></p>
<p>1. Given a binary tree convert it to a double linked list.</p>
<p>2. Given an array of integers , replace each element with the product of the remaining elements.
</p><pre>
  Eg : Input - 1 2 3 4     
       Output : 24 12 8 6 </pre>
<p>First, i gave the obvious solution. I  computed the product of the whole array and then divided it by each element to get the resultant array.</p>
<p>But he asked me to do it without using the division operation. After some cross questioning I gave the following solution.<br>
Store the product of the left side elements for each integer in an array L[].</p>
<pre>
For eg : Here , L[]= {1 , 1 , 2 , 6 }

Do the same for the right side elements.

Here R[] = { 24 , 12 , 4 , 1} 

The multiply R[i] and L[i]  to get the resultant array.
Complexity : O(n) </pre>
<p>Finally 2 people were selected.<br>
Result: Selected for a 6 month long internship as SDE-T (Testing)</p>
<p>GeeksForGeeks has been instrumental in my preparation for the interviews and I am really glad that I discovered this website at the right time.</p>
<p>PS : Could you guys tell me if the SDE-T position is inferior to the SDE-1 position or are they of the same level?</p>
