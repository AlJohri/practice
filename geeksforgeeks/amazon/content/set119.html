					<p>The selection procedure consisted of an online round followed by two Personal Interviews.<span id="more-130949"></span></p>
<p><strong>Online Round:</strong><br>
The first round had 20 mcq consisting of 3-4 questions from aptitude, 2 questions from os and rest were from Basic C and Data Structure. There were 2 coding questions as well.</p>
<p>Question 1:  You are given a phone keypad like following diagram, where each character corresponds to a digit mentioned in the same box.<br>
<img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/phoneKeyboard.png" width="120" height="160" class="alignnone"></p>
<p>You are given n strings and you have to find their decimal representation. You have to print the string and corresponding decimal representation in descending order.<br>
Like if you are given &#226;&#128;&#156;amazon&#226;&#128;&#157; then its corresponding decimal notation will be 262966.<br>
If more than one strings have same decimal notation then you have to print them in the order in which input is given.<br>
(Given that given string consists of lower case alphabets only.)
</p><pre>
Test Case 1:
5
Amazon
Microsoft
Facebook
Aa
Bb

Output:
642767638  microsoft
32232665  facebook
262966  amazon
22 aa
22 bb </pre>
<p>Question 2:  Given a string. Print all Possible permutations of different lengths in sorted order.
</p><pre>
Input: abc
Output:
A
Ab
Ac
Abc
b
Bc
c </pre>
<p>Candidate who could solve at least one question out of 2 coding questions was selected for personal Interviews. </p>
<p><strong>Round 2(P.I. 1) :-</strong><br>
Firstly interviewer had a deep discussion of my project. He also asked me to write code for one of my mini project (Backtracking).<br>
Then he asked two back to back coding questions &#226;&#128;&#147;</p>
<p>1.	You are given a bst. You have to print the kth smallest element.<br>
(<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/</a>).</p>
<p>2.	You are given two sorted arrays and you have to print the median obtained after merging them in log(n) time complexity.<br>
(<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/</a>)<br>
Then he asked the language in which I am comfortable for coding. I said C . Then he asked me to allocate the dynamic memory of 2-d array in C( I used malloc function for this). Then he asked me the difference b/w malloc and new (c++) function.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 (P.I. 2):-</strong><br>
Firstly he asked me to tell about my academic background. Then he directly put a coding question in front of me.<br>
1.	You are given a binary tree and two nodes. You have to print the horizontal distance between them. </p>
<p>Let us say :<br>
Given nodes are B and C : Answer would be 2.<br>
Given nodes are A and E : Answer would be 0.<br>
Given nodes are D and G : Answer would be 4.</p>
<p>We had an long discussion of 45 mins (approx.) on this problem.</p>
<p>One of my friend was asked the following questions:<br>
2.	Given a linked list. You have to determine whether or not it is a palindrome in order O(n) time without using auxiliary space.<br>
3.	You are given an array of integers . You have to find the maximum sum sequence.(It needs not be contiguous).</p>
<p>After all these rounds I and my friend both were selected <img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> :). A total of 16 candidates were selected.<br>
