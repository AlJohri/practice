					<p>Hai, recently amazon visited our campus for recruitment. Here is my amazon experience.<span id="more-130766"></span></p>
<p>1000 people attend round 1<br>
<strong>Round 1: (1.30 hrs)</strong><br>
20 MCQ&#8217;s + 2 coding question<br>
19 MCQ&#8217;s were from os,c++,java and single mcq from probability<br>
Coding questions:<br>
1. Find maximum sum in a array,such that no two elements are adjacent.<br>
For example 3,2,7,10 should return 13, sum of 3 and 10. Handle for negative cases too.<br>
2. Given a binary search tree,print the sum of all nodes that are in same axis (Modification of vertical order traversal)</p>
<p>I attended 12 mcq&#8217;s. There was negative marking,so i attended the questions which i was very confident and did both programs.<br>
I was confident that i will clear the round 1.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: (Group Fly Activity) ( 1 hr)</strong><br>
Around 36 people were shortlisted for second round.<br>
We were divided into many groups and each group was alloted a mentor.<br>
Two questions were given and we have to discuss the approach with mentor and only after getting his approval we have to code.<br>
1. Given a monotonically increasing and then decreasing array with duplicates and a key, return true if key exists in array.<br>
2. Given k sorted arrays of different or equal sizes, merge them into a single sorted array.<br>
Thanks to mentor, he was very cool and helpful, I did both the codes and handled corner cases too.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: (30-45 min)</strong><br>
18 people were shortlisted for third round and i was one among them.<br>
First the interviewer asked to tell about myself.<br>
Then he asked why i had low cgpa when compared with my school marks.<br>
Then came the first question<br>
1) Given n ropes of different length, combine them into a single rope,such that total cost is minimum. You can tie two ropes at a time,and cost of tying is sum of length of ropes.</p>
<p>First i gave a solution similar to insertion sort in a linked list,he was not satisfied, and then I gave a min heap approach. He asked for time complexity. I got wrong,so he asked what steps u will do and time complexity for each step. He added all the step cost and asked me to arrive at final time complexity.<br>
After this, I got correct.</p>
<p>Then he asked  about 2nd code in group fly activity.I used merge sort for it and he asked why i had used merge sort,and asked to improve the code.<br>
Then i gave a min heap solution (:P we discussed after group round). He asked me to code it. I was not good at heaps. I tried my best but unable to arrive at working code<br>
So finally he asked if i had any questions for him. I asked about amazon&#8217;s environment.After this i thanked and left.<br>
I was sure that i will be eliminated  and i was eliminated.<br>
Only 10 people went to 4th round and 3 people were hired finally.<br>
Here are some mistakes done by me<br>
It was first f2f for me and i was very nervous and had butterflies in stomach, which ultimately decreased my performance.<br>
I was not confident about the answer i gave.<br>
My communication skills  were very poor.<br>
So try  to avoid the mistakes done by me.</p>
