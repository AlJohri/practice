# Practice

A repository of various resources for practicing for computer science interviews.

The included `run` command makes it easier to run C++ and Java files as if you're running any scripting language. To be more precise, the script checks the file extension, and in the case of C++ files, compiles the code, runs the a.out file and then deletes it immediately afterwards.
