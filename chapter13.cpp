// 13.1 Write a method to print the last K lines of an input file using C++.

// 13.2 Compare and contrast a hash table and an STL map. How is a hash table implemented?
// If the number of inputs is small, which data structure options can be used
// instead of a hash table?

// 13.3 How do virtual functions work in C++?

// 13.4 What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would
// use each.

// 13.5 What is the significance of the keyword "volatile" in C?

// 13.6 Why does a destructor in base class need to be declared virtual?

// 13.7 Write a method that takes a pointer to a Node structure as a parameter and returns
// a complete copy of the passed in data structure. The Node data structure contains
// two pointers to other Nodes.

// 13.8 Write a smart pointer class. A smart pointer is a data type, usually implemented with
// templates, that simulates a pointer while also providing automatic garbage collection.
// It automatically counts the number of references to a SmartPointer<T*>
// object and frees the object of type T when the reference count hits zero.

// 13.9 Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such
// that the memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.

// 13.10 Write a function in C called my2DAlloc which allocates a two-dimensional array.
// Minimize the number of calls to malloc and make sure that the memory is accessible
// by the notation arr[i][j].
