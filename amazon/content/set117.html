					<p>Recently Amazon India visited our campus for 2 months internship. There were four rounds.<span id="more-130773"></span></p>
<p><strong>2 online coding questions + 20 MCQ : </strong><br>
MCQs had 15 questions(not exactly) on OS (to my surprise) , one aptitude(probability) and rest on c/c++</p>
<p><strong>2nd Round ( Group Interview / Written round) :</strong><br>
21 were selected for the second round. We had 2 questions. </p>
<p>1. Given two strings, find whether they are anagrams of each other. (too easy).<br>
Its here.. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/</a></p>
<p>2. Given a n-ary tree, Convert it into an array and return it. Construct the same n-ary tree from that array again. (DFS is better here as reconstruction is necessary) &#8211; </p>
<p>Push the root to a stack. &#8220;pop the stack.store the value of the root node and the number of children it has in the array.push all the children to a stack from right to left&#8221;.. do this until the stack becomes empty.. the array will have dfs along with the number of children of each node.</p>
<p>For reconstruction,pass &#8220;i&#8221; by reference( i is for iterating through the array) take the value at index 0 .. make it has root. increment i. for all the children of the root, recursively call the same function. return root. (I hope this works :P)</p>
<p><strong>3rd round (Face to Face):</strong><br>
Only 5 were selected.I was asked only one question and i didnt do well. Find the square root of a number. i answered that this can be done using Babylonian method. (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/</a>) or binary search method.. He asked me to implement Binary Search method. I did a mistake. then he asked me to correct it.. i corrected it. I wasn&#8217;t able to impress him much.</p>
<p>Remember the floating point arithmetic limitations.. this is where i failed.</p>
<p><strong>4th round (Face to Face):</strong><br>
I was called for 4th round. ( Only i had 4th round because of my bad performance in the 3rd round). The interviewer asked a lot of questions. They were easy</p>
<p>1.Given an array of 0s and 1s sorted. Find the first occurrence of 1 ( Binary Search)</p>
<p>2.Given an infinite array of 0s and 1s.(sorted) .Find the first occurence of 1(similar to this.. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-point-where-a-function-becomes-negative/%20" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-point-where-a-function-becomes-negative/ </a>)</p>
<p>3. Given a matrix sorted in ascending order both row and column wise. Search an element( <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/</a> ). This is O(n+m). He asked me a better solution.. I tried and he helped me a lot..Though i wasn&#8217;t able to deliver.</p>
<p>4. Given a tree, print the max sum path from root to leaf .. (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-sum-path-in-a-binary-tree/" target="_blank">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-sum-path-in-a-binary-tree/</a>)</p>
<p>5.Given a tree,print spirally the column order of a tree.
</p><pre>
ex :               1
              /         \
            2            3
          /   \        /    \
        4      5      6      7
o/p : 4 2 6 5 1 3 7 </pre>
<p>6. Implement a stack using array. Implement two stacks using an array. Implement 3 stacks. </p>
<p>7. You are given an array . You have to create a stack when the user wants to do so and delete a stack when the user says.You wont be given the number of stacks that will be created.</p>
