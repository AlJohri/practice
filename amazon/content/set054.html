					<p>Hi All. Here is my interview experience for internship at Amazon.<br>
Position: 2-Month Intern<br>
No. of Rounds: 1 Online + 2 PI (2 F2F)<span id="more-123697"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round 1: (90 minutes)</strong><br>
20 MCQs and 2 coding questions<br>
There were 20 MCQs based on C output, probability, basic maths, OOPS,  algorithm analysis and Operating Systems.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).<br>
Example:<br>
Inputs:  1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 3<br>
Output:  3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.<br>
Inputs:   1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 5<br>
Output:  5-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;NULL.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: </strong> Given a string containing words separated by arbitrary number of spaces. Write a function that returns a string consisting of the first letter of each word. (Note: there may be any number of spaces at the starting of the given string, at the end of the given string or in between words of the string.)<br>
Example:<br>
Input:  &#8221;   this  is   a  test case  &#8221;<br>
Output:  tiatc<br>
(Function prototypes and main was given for both the questions. Although many solutions passed the initial test cases, they were rejected later as they did not satisfy boundary cases.) </p>
<p><strong>Round 2: (face to face) (1 hour 20 min)</strong><br>
<strong>Question 1: </strong> Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is linked list representation of addition of two input numbers.<br>
Example
</p><pre>
Input:
 First List: 5-&gt;6-&gt;3  // represents number 563
 Second List: 8-&gt;4-&gt;2 //  represents number 842
Output
 Resultant list: 1-&gt;4-&gt;0-&gt;5  // represents number 1405</pre>
<p>I reversed the linked lists and simply added the corresponding nodes along with the carry. Then he asked me to solve the question without reversing the list. Then I solved the question iteratively without reversing the lists.<br>
The interviewer then asked me to write a recursive code for the same problem.<br>
After that he asked me to modify the code so that the carry at each place is passed by value instead of using pointers(which I had used in my code).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> iterative and recursive code to reverse a linked list(Take Care of corner cases: when list has no nodes or contains a single node) </p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Write a function to check whether a binary tree is a sub-tree of another binary tree (Check for all corner cases).<br>
I solved it in O(n^2) time complexity. He did not ask me to optimize my code.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Which data structure would you use to keep records of stock market?</p>
<p>I asked him to clarify the problem statement.</p>
<p>He then asked me : Suppose you have to maintain the stock values of various companies during various periods and return minimum stock value of a particular company over a given period of time.</p>
<p>I answered segment tree (Probably the correct answer was queue data structure).<br>
However the interviewer proceeded with questions on segment tree.<br>
He asked me to write a code for<br>
<strong>a) </strong>	Creating a segment tree<br>
<strong>b)</strong>	Performing range minimum query in a segment tree<br>
<strong>c) </strong>	Updating the segment tree<br>
He asked me to analyze the time complexity for building the segment tree and performing the range minimum query in the segment tree.<br>
He then asked me: If you are to maintain the stock value of a company for the past 6 months..then you have to update the segment tree every day by deleting a stock value and inserting a new stock value. How would you do that?<br>
Here I got stuck and could not perform the updation in better than O(n) time.(However using queue it can be performed in O(1) time) .</p>
<p>He finally asked me if I had any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: (face to face) (20 min)</strong><br>
Only one technical question was asked to me in this round.</p>
<p><strong>a) </strong> He asked me to speak something about myself and my technical achievements..</p>
<p><strong>b) </strong> How to store a binary tree in a file &amp; then read back.(It is not necessarily a BST)<br>
First I answered that I would store level-order traversal of the tree.<br>
He then asked me how I would maintain the nodes at various levels (which I was unable to answer). So, I changed my approach and told that: I would store in-order and pre-order traversals of the tree from which the original tree can be easily retrieved.<br>
But then he told me to optimize my approach (As this approach would require twice the original space to store the data in the nodes). I could not further optimize my approach (However the better approach was to use parenthesization.
</p><pre>

	                          	  A
       	                   		/   \
     	            	               B    C
     	              	             /   \
 	                	    D	  E </pre>
<p>If this is the binary tree then it can be stored as   (A(B(D),(E)),(C)) in the file.)<br>
<strong>c) </strong>Then there was a 10 min discussion my project , the problems I encountered and how I solved them.<br>
<strong>d) </strong>Finally he asked me if I had any questions.<br>
I asked about the intern projects at Amazon and the use of DBMS and NETWORKING in it.<br>
He started elaborating the entire work-process at Amazon and his work-experience&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;..most of which I could hardly understand. He also told me to have a good knowledge of JAVA as it will be required at some stage during the projects.</p>
<p>Finally I got selected.</p>
