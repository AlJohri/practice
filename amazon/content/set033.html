					<p>I recently attended a walk-in for Software development Engineer (SDE- 1) at Amazon, Bangalore. <span id="more-119437"></span></p>
<p>Here is my experience of Amazon interview.</p>
<p>As I was from the same city, there was no phone interview.  I have listed down all questions that I remember.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1: Data Structures, Algorithms and coding (1 hour)</strong></p>
<p>Interviewer just started off with questions without introduction and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Given a singly linked list, swap every 2 nodes, for odd number of input; retain the last node as it is.<br>
Eg: Input:  5 13 15 18 20 11 6 7<br>
Output: 13 5 18 15 11 20 7 6<br>
I was asked to write the code straight-away.<br>
Wrote the same, verified boundary cases and discussed.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong> Given a binary tree, find the number of pairs where sum of 2 nodes&#226;&#128;&#153; values equal to k<br>
Eg:
</p><pre>
 1
2 3
4 5 7 </pre>
<p>Say k=7, output =2 ( 2+5, 3+4)<br>
Suggested an approach where I&#226;&#128;&#153;d use inorder traversal of this,<br>
Then interviewer asked me to solve the simplified problem, find k in sorted array instead of tree.<br>
Got solution for this one, to have 2 pointers at each end, and traverse accordingly.<br>
I was asked the approach for extending same to BST.<br>
Then, I implemented the same for BST using stack.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: Data Structures, Algorithms and coding (1 hour)</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>     Given input as k sorted arrays, generate a single sorted list as output.<br>
Eg:<br>
Array1: 1 5 8 9 11 &#226;&#128;&#166;.<br>
Array2: 2 12 24 44 &#226;&#128;&#166;..<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Arrayk: 3 15 79 115 &#226;&#128;&#166;.<br>
Output: Array1: 1 2 3 5 8 9 11 12 15 &#226;&#128;&#166;.<br>
Discussed the approach, and complexity, then wrote the code for the same.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>   Given a function isGreater, compare user defined objects and then return the object that is greater than all other objects.<br>
Twist: obj1 &gt; obj2 and obj2 &gt; obj3 does not mean obj1&gt;obj3<br>
I asked for the use case for the same, as I was not convinced with the problem.<br>
He gave an example of games/ 1 team winning another.<br>
Discussed the approach and then wrote the code.</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong>     Given an input sentence, output the non repeated words in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong>     How are maps implemented?</p>
<p>Interviewer then clarified my questions about Amazon.</p>
<p>Both first and second rounds were at similar difficulty level.</p>
<p>If the interview feedback was bad for any of these, the candidate was eliminated. If at least 1 of these went well and other &#226;&#128;&#156;not sure&#226;&#128;&#157;, then too candidate is called for next rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: Hiring Manager round (1 hour 40 minutes)</strong><br>
Discussed on my current roles and responsibilities</p>
<p>why do you want to join to Amazon?</p>
<p>What are your accomplishments in your role so far?</p>
<p>What are the things that you&#226;&#128;&#153;re not good at and need to improve?</p>
<p>Serialization of Binary tree. Given 1 traversal is it possible to re-construct the binary tree.</p>
<p>Write code to reconstruct the tree given any 2 traversals.<br>
I took in-order and post-order traversal, discussed the approach and wrote recursive solution.<br>
Was then asked the approach for iterative.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: Culture Fit Round</strong><br>
This surprisingly had a data structure question first.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong>      Given a n (large number) lists of customers who visited n webpages on n (large number) days, design a data structure to get customers who have visited the website on exactly &#8220;k&#8221; days and should have visited at least &#8220;m&#8221; distinct pages altogether.<br>
Was then asked to improvise the solution as much as possible</p>
<p><strong>2)  </strong>    Details on my previous project and job profile</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>      Challenging situation faced</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>      Why should we hire you?</p>
<p>Then, he answered some of my questions.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5: Coding, Algorithm and data structures (Technical round with a senior developer)</strong></p>
<p>Started with questions straight away</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>     Least common ancestor of a binary tree  (Solution and Code)</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>     Given a 2 dimensional array sorted vertically and horizontally, search for an element and return true if the element is present. (Algorithm, Code and Complexity)</p>
<p>Example
</p><pre>                1             5           13           29

                11           16           25           38          

                45           49           52           57

                51           54           59           66</pre>
<p><strong>3) </strong>     Something on count sort.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong>     Print binary tree in zig-zag order..</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong>     Gold box problem (Approach)</p>
<p>There are &#226;&#128;&#152;n&#226;&#128;&#153; gold boxes placed in a row, each having different number of gold coins.</p>
<p>2 players play a game, where the motive is to collect the maximum number of gold coins. Each player can see how many coins are present in each box, but can get a box from either end only, on his turn.</p>
<p>Design a strategy such that Player1 wins (Assuming both players play smartly)</p>
<p>I got the hiring call after couple of days, after my last round of interview.  They said feedback was very positive and they&#226;&#128;&#153;re happy to hire me.  </p>
<p>Was so happy <img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> <img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> Thank you..</p>
