<ol>
<li>You have given M array each of size n all array are sorted separately write a program to make a big sorted array of size m*n . during discussion he told me to prove many lemma like height of tree is log(n)( for n elements) sum of n natural number is (n*n+1)/2 and many more. He modified problem many times don&#226;&#128;&#153;t use extra space do it in space etc. discussion went on for almost 1 hour but at the end he was happy with the solutions(I suggested 2 method and further optimization in them.</li>
<li>U have given an binary matrix which is sorted row wise and column wise write a program to search a row in the matrix having maximum number of zeroes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally this interview also went well he was happy with my performance</p>
<p>After 2-3 days I got mail from the HR that I m rejected LL reason was bar raiser &#226;&#128;&#166; 1 advise to all don&#226;&#128;&#153;t take BR round lightly it does not matter how well u performed in other round if u didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t do well in BR round then there is no way u can make it. An average round tech interview is fine but average BR round means rejected.</p>
