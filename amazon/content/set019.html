<div class="post-content" id="post-content">
					<p>I recently had a set of interviews with Amazon.com and listing below the questions. The day had around 15-20 of us at their office and the whole process took close to 12 hrs.<span id="more-113895"></span></p>
<p>Hope, people can reap benefit from it. <img src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p>
<div><strong>1st Round:&#194;&#160;</strong>Online Written round.</div>
<div>a. Determine if a matrix is a cross-matrix.</div>
<div>&#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; A cross-matrix is a one in which all the&#194;&#160;diagonal&#194;&#160;elements are same and not repeated anywhere else.</div>
<div>b. Print the level-order in reverse order, i.e. from Bottom to top.</div>
<div>c. One more easy question, which I&#194;&#160;don&#8217;t&#194;&#160;remember now.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>2nd Round:</strong>&#194;&#160;F2F- Developer</div>
<div>a. Kadane&#8217;s Algo.</div>
<div>However, it was hidden behind a good problem set.</div>
<div>Interviewer wanted to identify whether I can recognize the same.</div>
<div>I did not remember it instantly but was able to prove it by solving.</div>
<div></div>
<div>b. Linked-list intersection point.</div>
<div>Again, had to decipher the above from a different problem set.</div>
<div>[A tree with only parent pointer, how to find LCA?]<br>
Was able to easily identify the same and we quickly moved onto other things.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>3rd Round :</strong>&#194;&#160;Hiring Manager</div>
<div>a. Design a stack which can perform findMax in O(1).</div>
<div>Had read the answer once in some book and duly told him have heard it.</div>
<div>He verified and we moved on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>b. Set of stocks for each day have been given. Need to find the days on which I buy and sell share to earn max profit, alongwith finding the max profit.</div>
<div>Had to write the code, which I was able to do well.</div>
<div>He was impressed and I felt I had a good chance.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>4th Round</strong>&#194;&#160;: Developer</div>
<div>a. Find top k searched elements from a&#194;&#160;continuous&#194;&#160;stream of data.</div>
<div>I remember we needed to use Min Heap but his constraint was using a continuous&#194;&#160;stream.</div>
<div>Finally was able to do it with his help.</div>
<div>b. Some design question based upon his team&#8217;s problems.</div>
<div>Had to use a queue and a hashmap to solve it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He was very much&#194;&#160;interested&#194;&#160;in whether I could identify the complexities correctly.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>5th Round</strong>&#194;&#160;: Manager &#8211; Different Team</div>
<div>a. Given a linked-list and 2 integers k &amp; m. Reverse the linked-list till k elements and then traverse till m elements and repeat.</div>
<div>Write production quality code.</div>
<div>I am not sure what happened and why I fell off on such an easy question, but you just can do something like that in the last round.</div>
<div></div>
<div>b. An array of elements have been given. Find for each element, first max element to its right.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Was able to do it well, however lost it on complexity analysis.</div>
<div></div>
<div>c. Boundary traversal of a tree. Write the code.</div>
<div>Wrote the code, however he was not able to check the same as took a lot of time.</div>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title=""> </pre>
<div>Before this round, I had good hope of getting selected, but&#194;&#160;no one&#194;&#160;can give such a bad last interview and get selected and hence after 2 weeks got a rejection mail.</div>
