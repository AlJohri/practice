<div>Started with general introduction , asked about my work , know any design patterns and where you applied them in your project etc.</div>
<div>He asked a single question to design a single stack with push , pop and pop mid operations , followed by working code.</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>F2F2:</strong></span></div>
<div>Again started with general introduction , work i do , then he gave a question about finding count of each occurrence of words in a document.</div>
<div>I gave hashing based solution (with working code), it lead to a great discussion on hashing , then he led me to give a solution with tries . As much time is not left he asked me to tell the approach only.</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>F2F3 (With Bar raiser):</strong></span></div>
<div>Bar raiser will be from a different team.</div>
<div>He asked me a question to connect siblings at each levels of a binary tree , as i knew this question already. He wanted working code. After i gave the code he found a bug and i found one myself.After resolving the code he moved on to different question.</div>
<div>Next question is optimal implementation of 3 or more stacks in a single array.I gave some approached based on heuristics and with extra memory.He dint seem satisfied and then asked many questions about work i do and grilled me on many aspects.</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>F2F4(With Hiring Manager):</strong></span></div>

<div><b>Some tips:</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Practice lot of pen and paper code.</li>
<li>Folks at amazon do not want pseudo code , they want working code with minimal syntactical errors.</li>
<li>Online plus telephonic rounds are for screening only.Also , Don&#8217;t pass the time in telephonic rounds, they want to give at least two questions (easy though)</li>
<li>McDowell&#8217;s book and recent 40 sets of amazon interview experiences will make you good to go.</li>
</ol>
