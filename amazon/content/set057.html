					<p>Hi geeks, I recently hired for amazon. I just want to share my Interview experience with You all.<span id="more-125596"></span></p>
<p>Totally 1 Written + 5 F2F</p>
<p><strong>Written round:</strong><br>
Q1: Convert a sorted integer Array to balanced binary search tree. This is very simple one and I could do it in O(n) time and O(1)extra space.</p>
<p>Q2: Write a Program to reverse every k nodes of singly linked list without using extra space. Constraint: k&gt;=2</p>
<p><strong>F2F round 1:</strong><br>
Q1: Find the largest element in the sorted rotated integer array in o(log n) time.</p>
<p>Q2: Find Height of a Binary Tree. This is very easy question, so I did quickly.then he move on to next one.</p>
<p>Q3: Find your own method to balance an unbalanced binary tree.(you must not use existing methods like AVL, red black or b trees).<br>
Hint: There is no restriction on placing nodes. You can remove any node from any place and put it in any place.<br>
I devised an algorithm which will make use of two lists.&#194;&#160;One list contains nodes far away from the root and this is sorted in decreasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level.&#194;&#160;Other list contains nodes which are not fully filled. This is sorted increasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level .<br>
Remove the first node (listed in list1) and insert as a child of first node in list2.add this node also in list 2.&#194;&#160;Do this operation until the height of the tree becomes log(n).&#194;&#160;Interviewer was impressed with this and finished the interview.</p>
<p><strong>F2F round 2:</strong><br>
Q1: There is a file which contains N words. There may be M anagrams in that file, K words on each anagrams. K&gt;=1, M&gt;=1, N&gt;=1. You need to write an algorithm which will create one list for each anagram with k words and group all M lists with one data structure (This is the main area.we need to think a data structure which will minimize the space and time complexity of word Finding appropriate List and Inserting word).<br>
I could do the insertion in O(1) time by keeping track of tail pointer in each list.&#194;&#160;But finding the appropriate list needs&#194;&#160;o(n) in case of linked list, o(log(n)) in case of binary search tree. Using hash table, you can do this in o(1), but writing a hash function is difficult and inefficient in terms of time. Then I suggested Trie data structure.with this, we can reduce the time complexity well. But space complexity will be more.&#194;&#160;I told all the ideas to interviewer. They were much satisfied with this. And moved to next question(without writing code J)</p>
<p>Q2: Find min and max element of an unsorted integer array.<br>
Very simple question you can do two pass on the array and find it, but number of comparisons will be o(2n). He asked me to reduce it.<br>
I gave an algorithm which will do the same in O((n/2)*3) which is fairly less than o(2n). They were impressed on my solution and asked weather I have any question .</p>
<p><strong>F2F round 3: (CS fundamentals and system programming)</strong><br>
Questions were in C++ patterns, Network Programming, Linux, since I did project on networking, Linux I could perform well in this round.</p>
<p><strong>F2F round 4: (Hiring manager round):</strong><br>
Interviewer was keen on testing cultural fit. Nearly 10 to 15 questions on my previous project,<br>
Why amazon?<br>
Why you want to leave previous company?<br>
What initiative you took in prevous company?<br>
How will you manage conflict with your manager?<br>
How will you demonstrate ur product to customer?</p>
<p><strong>F2F round 5: (bar raiser)</strong><br>
This also had cultural fit questions and then a data structure question.<br>
Qn: Find the distance between two nodes in a binary tree, no parent pointers are given. I could solve this in post order traversal in o(n) time complexity. He asked me to code in home and send it via mail.</p>
