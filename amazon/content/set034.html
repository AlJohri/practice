					<p>First of all, a very very big thanks to whole team of geeks for geeks. It is because of them only that I was able to crack the interview process of amazon and get a job in my dream company. <span id="more-121481"></span></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong>	Given three linked lists,where each linked list represents a number, add the three lists and return the resultant list.<br>
5-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;NULL<br>
9-&gt;1-&gt;NULL<br>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Online test 2 (Time): 45 Minutes</strong><br>
<strong>1.</strong>	Convert a given binary tree to sum tree.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>	Given an array consisting of both positive and negative numbers, 0 is considered as positive, rearrange the elements such that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively, constraints are that it should be in-place and order of elements should not change.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 1(75 Minutes):</strong><br>
Technical Interview<br>
Asked to  give a brief idea about my project.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Given a linked list,reverse every k nodes of  the linked list.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>  given a matrix of size  m * n, place k students in such a way so that cheating in an exam could be minimized&#226;&#128;&#166;. Was asked  to just explain the approach, no code required.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> suppose a online chat between customer and serviceman, serviceman wants to reply to customer as soon as possible&#226;&#128;&#166;suppose text which is to be sent as reply takes 10 sec for being typed. How can he make typing faster ?<br>
My answer was using autoprediction feature, by which he will need to type less number of characters, so typing will become faster..<br>
Then question was extended to how to store the words for being used in prediction&#226;&#128;&#166;<br>
I answered a trie data structure which allows prefix matching..<br>
Then question was further extended to write a code to  traverse all the words stored in dictionary in lexicographic order..</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 2(50-60 Minutes):</strong><br>
Technical Interview<br>
First of all was asked to tell something about myself.<br>
Then a detailed discussion about the project, conversation continued nearly for 20 minutes, he wanted me to explain him everything from the scratch.. I used genetic algorithm in my project..so he  wanted to explain him the concept of genetic algorithm..<br>
Then a coding question:: stable stock problem.<br>
You are given prices of stock of a company at  consecutive days in an array..write a code to find the maximum profit one can make by keeping a stock value for as long as possible..that value of a stock is called a stable stock value.<br>
Example::<br>
6 5 9 8 3<br>
So maximum profit is 15, because stock of value 5 would be hold  for  3 days. So max profit is 15.<br>
The problem basically was a variation of  finding  index of next smaller element.<br>
I solved it using the concept of largest rectangular area in a histogram where need to keep track of previous  smaller will not be required.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 3(60-75 Minutes): (Bar Raiser Round)</strong><br>
Technical Interview<br>
Interviewer was very cool.. he first asked about me, did some casual talk to do away with my nervousness.<br>
Infact, he told me that  it looks like that you all have studied geeks for geeks very thoroughly so I am going to ask you a question that is not present in geeks for geeks. He challenged me it will be a question you have not heard of  before.  At  the end of round, he showed me it was a question from top coder, but I had never heard of anything called top coder before.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Given a string, find the longest sinusoidal sequence in it. If there are multiple such sequences of same maximum length, return the one which comes first in lexicographic order in a dictionary..<br>
Sinusoidal means increasing then decreasing then increasing and so on.<br>
Example ::<br>
a r u n ::<br>
 a  u n , a r n , r u n are three such sequences of length 3&#226;&#128;&#166;. But,  a r n is output  since it comes first in lexicographic order.<br>
Interviewer gave me hints that if I had to found the  sequence in which all elements were increasing, then I answered LIS will give me the solution , this was the hint. So, basically, it was a variation of LIS. I answered it in O(n2) and  2n space&#226;&#128;&#166;.<br>
Then was asked to do it in (n) space and o(n).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: </strong>  Suppose a student needs to implement a bst structure to solve a problem, but instead he used a linked list&#226;&#128;&#166;. Then give an example of input sequence, in which his implementation works&#226;&#128;&#166; new value will always be added at beginning of a linked list.. so. Basically at each step after insertion , root of  bst and head of link list should point to same node. I was asked to provide the sequence.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 4( 35 Minutes)</strong><br>
This  round  started  of  with some nontechnical  questions.. what will I do in different situations?<br>
They seemed to have found out every detail of terms involved in my project..so, there was a detailed discussion on project&#226;&#128;&#166; my project involved concepts of statistics, so he asked me questions regarding stats&#226;&#128;&#166;. This discussion went nearly for half an hour&#226;&#128;&#166;. In the end, he told me lets see whether your project could bring you to amazon&#226;&#128;&#166;.<br>
After the 4th round, I nearly have to wait for 4 hours before the result were announced. Finally, the interviewer said they were highly impressed by me and I was hired.<br>
In total 7 students were selected among us.<br>
Once again a big thanks to whole geeksforgeeks team.</p>
