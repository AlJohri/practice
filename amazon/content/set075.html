					<p>I  am currently in my 8th semester . I recently attended the off campus drive for SDE1 at Amazon. Here&#8217;s my journey.<span id="more-127939"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round 1:- (Written)</strong><br>
This was a written round . It was hosted on interview street.<br>
It was a 90 minutes test with 20 mcq and 2 codes<br>
1&gt; Return the longest palindromic substring in a string<br>
2&gt; Count the number of 2&#8217;s in all number from 0 to n .<br>
Mcq&#8217;s were based on ds algo,operating system and maths.</p>
<p>After two days I got a call from the hr that  I have cleared the written and a phonescreen is to be scheduled.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:- (Phone screen 1)</strong><br>
This was supposed to be a 1 hour round. The interviewer shared a collabedit link.</p>
<p>1&gt; Divide an array into 2 subarrays such that the absolute difference of their sum is minimum. It was then extended to divide into two subsequences .</p>
<p>2&gt; Convert a sorted array to a balanced binary search tree.</p>
<p>3&gt; Convert a linkedlist with positive and negative integers into a list with first all negative integers, then positive. order amongst negative and positive numbers to be maintained .</p>
<p>Generally if first phonescreen is convincing the next step is direct face to face interview , else one has to go through another phonescreen . I had one phonescreen only . After a month i was called for inhouse interviews . All arrangements were made by them . </p>
<p><strong>Round 3 :- (Face to Face 1)</strong><br>
1&gt; Define a BST. Now check if a binary tree is a BST<br>
2&gt; Given an array of size n, and an integer k. find minimum number in every subarray of size k<br>
3&gt; Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining<br>
4&gt; Given an array find all triplets whose sum is equal to a given number k</p>
<p><strong>Round 4 :- (Face to Face 2)</strong><br>
1&gt; Find the diameter of a tree.<br>
2&gt; Print the diameter of a binary tree . (U have only left and right pointers)<br>
3&gt; Assembly scheduling problem (Dynamic Programming paradigm)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5 :- (Face to Face 3)</strong><br>
1&gt; How to check if two sets are disjoint ?<br>
2&gt; How to implement hashing for a set  .<br>
3&gt; Given n sets , give the minimal number of sets which must be removed so that the remaining sets are all disjoint (Variation of set packing problem)<br>
The interviewer was interested in some greedy heuristic as he knew its an np complete problem  and no solution can be better than exponential<br>
4&gt; You are given a matrix of 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s . The property is that<br>
every row of matrix is sorted in descending order . Return row with maximum number of 0&#8217;s</p>
<p><strong>Round 6 :- (With senior manager)</strong><br>
Interview started with detailed discussion of projects.<br>
1&gt; Implement lastindexofastring(String s1,String s2) . If s2 is present multiple times return the last index of s2 in s1 , else return -1.<br>
2&gt; Given a paragraph of text, write a program to find the first shortest sub-segment that contains each of the given k words at least once. A segment is said to be shorter than other if it contains less number of words.</p>
<p>The interviewer then asked me if i had done something on multithreading . As i was not very confident so i said no and  he dint go further .<br>
He then asked me what is my biggest regret in my student life in college .</p>
<p>Amazon hr&#8217;s were extremely helpful. After 3 days I got a confirmation call that I was hired. Geeksforgeeks has been instrumental in helping a lot of people to land  up in good companies.
