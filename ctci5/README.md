# Cracking the Coding Interview, 5th Edition

Each file represents the problems from a single chapter.

I tried to use C++ for most problems that deal with character arrays, linked lists, trees, etc. Anything more algorithmic (greedy algorithms, dynamic programming etc.) I tend to use python. Obviously, the Java chapter uses Java.

## Example Usage

```
./run ctci5/chapter01.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter02.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter03.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter04.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter05.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter09.py
./run ctci5/chapter13.cpp
./run ctci5/chapter14.java
```
